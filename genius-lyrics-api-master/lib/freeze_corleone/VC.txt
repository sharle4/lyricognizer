but this too is true stories can save us i m fortythree years old and a writer now and even still right here i keep dreaming linda alive and ted lavender too and kiowa and curt lemon and a slim young man i killed and an old man sprawled beside a pigpen and several others whose bodies i once lifted and dumped into a truck they re all dead but in a story which is a kind of dreaming the dead sometimes smile and sit up and return to the world start here a body without a name on an afternoon in 1969 the platoon took sniper fire from a filthy little village along the south china sea it lasted only a minute or two and nobody was hurt but even so lieutenant jimmy cross got on the radio and ordered up an air strike for the next half hour we watched the place burn it was a cool bright morning like early autumn and the jets were glossy black against the sky when it ended we formed into a loose line and swept east through the village it was all wreckage i remember the smell of burnt straw i remember broken fences and tornup trees and heaps of stone and brick and pottery the place was desertedno people no animalsand the only confirmed kill was an old man who lay faceup near a pigpen at the center of the village his right arm was gone at his face there were already many flies and gnats dave jensen went over and shook the old man s hand howdee doo he said one by one the others did it too they didn t disturb the body they just grabbed the old man s hand and offered a few words and moved away rat kiley bent over the corpse gimme five he said a real honor pleased as punch said henry dobbins i was brandnew to the war it was my fourth day i hadn t yet developed a sense of humor right away as if i d swallowed something i felt a moist sickness rise up in my throat i sat down beside the pigpen closed my eyes put my head between my knees after a moment dave jensen touched my shoulder be polite now he said go introduce yourself nothing to be afraid about just a nice old man show a little respect for your elders no way maybe it s too real for you that s right i said way too real jensen kept after me but i didn t go near the body i didn t even look at it except by accident for the rest of the day there was still that sickness inside me but it wasn t the old man s corpse so much it was that awesome act of greeting the dead at one point i remember they sat the body up against a fence they crossed his legs and talked to him the guest of honor mitchell sanders said and he placed a can of orange slices in the old man s lap vitamin c he said gently a guy s health that s the most important thing they proposed toasts they lifted their canteens and drank to the old man s family and ancestors his many grandchildren his newfound life after death it was more than mockery there was a formality to it like a funeral without the sadness dave jensen flicked his eyes at me hey o brien he said you got a toast in mind never too late for manners i found things to do with my hands i looked away and tried not to think late in the afternoon just before dusk kiowa came up and asked if he could sit at my foxhole for a minute he offered me a christmas cookie from a batch his father had sent him it was february now but the cookies tasted fine for a few moments kiowa watched the sky you did a good thing today he said that shaking hands crap it isn t decent the guys ll hassle you for a whileespecially jensenbut just keep saying no should ve done it myself takes guts i know that it wasn t guts i was scared kiowa shrugged same difference  no i couldn t do it a mental block or something    i don t know just creepy well you re new here you ll get used to it he paused for a second studying the green and red sprinkles on a cookie todayi guess this was your first look at a real body i shook my head all day long i d been picturing linda s face the way she smiled it sounds funny i said but that poor old man he reminds me of i mean there s this girl i used to know i took her to the movies once my first date kiowa looked at me for a long while then he leaned back and smiled man he said that s a bad date linda was nine then as i was but we were in love and it was real when i write about her now three decades later it s tempting to dismiss it as a crush an infatuation of childhood but i know for a fact that what we felt for each other was as deep and rich as love can ever get it had all the shadings and complexities of mature adult love and maybe more because there were not yet words for it and because it was not yet fixed to comparisons or chronologies or the ways by which adults measure such things i just loved her she had poise and great dignity her eyes i remember were deep brown like her hair and she was slender and very quiet and fragile looking even then at nine years old i wanted to live inside her body i wanted to melt into her bonesthat kind of love and so in the spring of 1956 when we were in the fourth grade i took her out on the first real date of my lifea double date actually with my mother and father though i can t remember the exact sequence my mother had somehow arranged it with linda s parents and on that damp spring night my dad did the driving while linda and i sat in the back seat and stared out opposite windows both of us trying to pretend it was nothing special for me though it was very special down inside i had important things to tell her big profound things but i couldn t make any words come out i had trouble breathing now and then i d glance over at her thinking how beautiful she was her white skin and those dark brown eyes and the way she always smiled at the worldalways it seemedas if her face had been designed that way the smile never went away that night i remember she wore a new red cap which seemed to me very stylish and sophisticated very unusual it was a stocking cap basically except the tapered part at the top seemed extra long almost too long like a tail growing out of the back of her head it made me think of the caps that santa s elves wear the same shape and color the same fuzzy white tassel at the tip sitting there in the back seat i wanted to find some way to let her know how i felt a compliment of some sort but all i could manage was a stupid comment about the cap jeez i must ve said what a cap linda smiled at the windowshe knew what i meantbut my mother turned and gave me a hard look it surprised me it was as if i d brought up some horrible secret for the rest of the ride i kept my mouth shut we parked in front of the ben franklin store and walked up main street toward the state theater my parents went first side by side and then linda in her new red cap and then me tailing along ten or twenty steps behind i was nine years old i didn t yet have the gift for small talk now and then my mother glanced back making little motions with her hand to speed me up at the ticket booth i remember linda stood off to one side i moved over to the concession area studying the candy and both of us were very careful to avoid the awkwardness of eye contact which was how we knew about being in love it was pure knowing neither of us i suppose would ve thought to use that word love but by the fact of not looking at each other and not talking we understood with a clarity beyond language that we were sharing something huge and permanent behind me in the theater i heard cartoon music hey step it up i said i almost had the courage to look at her you want popcorn or what the thing about a story is that you dream it as you tell it hoping that others might then dream along with you and in this way memory and imagination and language combine to make spirits in the head there is the illusion of aliveness in vietnam for instance ted lavender had a habit of popping four or five tranquilizers every morning it was his way of coping just dealing with the realities and the drugs helped to ease him through the days i remember how peaceful his eyes were even in bad situations he had a soft dreamy expression on his face which was what he wanted a kind of escape how s the war today somebody would ask and ted lavender would give a little smile to the sky and say mellowa nice smooth war today and then in april he was shot in the head outside the village of than khe kiowa and i and a couple of others were ordered to prepare his body for the dustoff i remember squatting down not wanting to look but then looking lavender s left cheekbone was gone there was a swollen blackness around his eye quickly trying not to feel anything we went through the kid s pockets i remember wishing i had gloves it wasn t the blood i hated it was the deadness we put his personal effects in a plastic bag and tied the bag to his arm we stripped off the canteens and ammo all the heavy stuff and wrapped him up in his own poncho and carried him out to a dry paddy and laid him down for a while nobody said much then mitchell sanders laughed and looked over at the green plastic poncho hey lavender he said how s the war today there was a short quiet mellow somebody said well that s good sanders murmured that s real real good stay cool now hey no sweat i m mellow just ease on back then don t need no pills we got this incredible chopper on call this once in a lifetime mindtrip oh yeahmellow mitchell sanders smiled there it is my man this chopper gonna take you up high and cool gonna relax you gonna alter your whole perspective on this sorry sorry shit we could almost see ted lavender s dreamy blue eyes we could almost hear him roger that somebody said i m ready to fly there was the sound of the wind the sound of birds and the quiet afternoon which was the world we were in  that s what a story does the bodies are animated you make the dead talk they sometimes say things like roger that or they say timmy stop crying which is what linda said to me after she was dead even now i can see her walking down the aisle of the old state theater in worthington minnesota i can see her face in profile beside me the cheeks softly lighted by coming attractions the movie that night was the man who never was i remember the plot clearly or at least the premise because the main character was a corpse that fact alone i know deeply impressed me it was a world war two film the allies devise a scheme to mislead germany about the site of the upcoming landings in europe they get their hands on a bodya british soldier i believe they dress him up in an officer s uniform plant fake documents in his pockets then dump him in the sea and let the currents wash him onto a nazi beach the germans find the documents the deception wins the war even now i can remember the awful splash as that corpse fell into the sea i remember glancing over at linda thinking it might be too much for her but in the dim gray light she seemed to be smiling at the screen there were little crinkles at her eyes her lips open and gently curving at the corners i couldn t understand it there was nothing to smile at once or twice in fact i had to close my eyes but it didn t help much even then i kept seeing the soldier s body tumbling toward the water splashing down hard how inert and heavy it was how completely dead it was a relief when the movie finally ended afterward we drove out to the dairy queen at the edge of town the night had a quilted weighteddown quality as if somehow burdened and all around us the minnesota prairies reached out in long repetitive waves of corn and soybeans everything flat everything the same i remember eating ice cream in the back seat of the buick and a long blank drive in the dark and then pulling up in front of linda s house things must ve been said but it s all gone now except for a few last images i remember walking her to the front door i remember the brass porch light with its fierce yellow glow my own feet the juniper bushes along the front steps the wet grass linda close beside me we were in love nine years old yes but it was real love and now we were alone on those front steps finally we looked at each other bye i said  linda nodded and said bye over the next few weeks linda wore her new red cap to school every day she never took it off not even in the classroom and so it was inevitable that she took some teasing about it most of it came from a kid named nick veenhof out on the playground during recess nick would creep up behind her and make a grab for the cap almost yanking it off then scampering away it went on like that for weeks the girls giggling the guys egging him on naturally i wanted to do something about it but it just wasn t possible i had my reputation to think about i had my pride and there was also the problem of nick veenhof so i stood off to the side just a spectator wishing i could do things i couldn t do i watched linda clamp down the cap with the palm of her hand holding it there smiling over in nick s direction as if none of it really mattered for me though it did matter it still does i should ve stepped in fourth grade is no excuse besides it doesn t get easier with time and twelve years later when vietnam presented much harder choices some practice at being brave might ve helped a little also too i might ve stopped what happened next maybe not but at least it s possible most of the details i ve forgotten or maybe blocked out but i know it was an afternoon in late spring and we were taking a spelling test and halfway into it nick veenhof held up his hand and asked to use the pencil sharpener right away the kids laughed no doubt he d broken the pencil on purpose but it wasn t something you could prove and so the teacher nodded and told him to hustle it up which was a mistake out of nowhere nick developed a terrible limp he moved in slow motion dragging himself up to the pencil sharpener and carefully slipping in his pencil and then grinding away forever at the time i suppose it was funny but on the way back to his seat nick took a short detour he squeezed between two desks turned sharply right and moved up the aisle toward linda i saw him grin at one of his pals in a way i already knew what was coming as he passed linda s desk he dropped the pencil and squatted down to get it when he came up his left hand slipped behind her back there was a halfsecond hesitation maybe he was trying to stop himself maybe then just briefly he felt some small approximation of guilt but it wasn t enough he took hold of the white tassel stood up and gently lifted off her cap somebody must ve laughed i remember a short tinny echo i remember nick veenhof trying to smile somewhere behind me a girl said uh or a sound like that linda didn t move even now when i think back on it i can still see the glossy whiteness of her scalp she wasn t bald not quite not completely there were some tufts of hair little patches of grayish brown fuzz but what i saw then and keep seeing now is all that whiteness a smooth pale translucent white i could see the bones and veins i could see the exact structure of her skull there was a large bandaid at the back of her head a row of black stitches a piece of gauze taped above her left ear nick veenhof took a step backward he was still smiling but the smile was doing strange things the whole time linda stared straight ahead her eyes locked on the blackboard her hands loosely folded at her lap she didn t say anything after a time though she turned and looked at me across the room it lasted only a moment but i had the feeling that a whole conversation was happening between us well she was saying and i was saying sure okay later on she cried for a while the teacher helped her put the cap back on then we finished the spelling test and did some fingerpainting and after school that day nick veenhof and i walked her home it s now 1990 i m fortythree years old which would ve seemed impossible to a fourth grader and yet when i look at photographs of myself as i was in 1956 i realize that in the important ways i haven t changed at all i was timmy then now i m tim but the essence remains the same i m not fooled by the baggy pants or the crew cut or the happy smilei know my own eyesand there is no doubt that the timmy smiling at the camera is the tim i am now inside the body or beyond the body there is something absolute and unchanging the human life is all one thing like a blade tracing loops on ice a little kid a twentythree yearold infantry sergeant a middleaged writer knowing guilt and sorrow and as a writer now i want to save linda s life not her bodyher life  she died of course nine years old and she died it was a brain tumor she lived through the summer and into the first part of september and then she was dead but in a story i can steal her soul i can revive at least briefly that which is absolute and unchanging in a story miracles can happen linda can smile and sit up she can reach out touch my wrist and say timmy stop crying i needed that kind of miracle at some point i had come to understand that linda was sick maybe even dying but i loved her and just couldn t accept it in the middle of the summer i remember my mother tried to explain to me about brain tumors now and then she said bad things start growing inside us sometimes you can cut them out and other times you can t and for linda it was one of the times when you can t i thought about it for several days all right i finally said so will she get better now well no my mother said i don t think so she stared at a spot behind my shoulder sometimes people don t ever get better they die sometimes i shook my head not linda i said but on a september afternoon during noon recess nick veenhof came up to me on the school playground your girlfriend he said she kicked the bucket at first i didn t understand she s dead he said my mom told me at lunchtime no lie she actually kicked the goddang bucket all i could do was nod somehow it didn t quite register i turned away glanced down at my hands for a second then walked home without telling anyone it was a little after one o clock i remember and the house was empty i drank some chocolate milk and then lay down on the sofa in the living room not really sad just floating trying to imagine what it was to be dead nothing much came to me i remember closing my eyes and whispering her name almost begging trying to make her come back linda i said please and then i concentrated i willed her alive it was a dream i suppose or a daydream but i made it happen i saw her coming down the middle of main street all alone it was nearly dark and the street was deserted no cars or people and linda wore a pink dress and shiny black shoes i remember sitting down on the curb to watch all her hair had grown back the scars and stitches were gone in the dream if that s what it was she was playing a game of some sort laughing and running up the empty street kicking a big aluminum water bucket right then i started to cry after a moment linda stopped and carried her water bucket over to the curb and asked why i was so sad well god i said you re dead linda nodded at me she was standing under a yellow streetlight a nineyearold girl just a kid and yet there was something ageless in her eyesnot a child not an adultjust a bright ongoing everness that same pinprick of absolute lasting light that i see today in my own eyes as timmy smiles at tim from the graying photographs of that time dead i said linda smiled it was a secret smile as if she knew things nobody could ever know and she reached out and touched my wrist and said timmy stop crying it doesn t matter in vietnam too we had ways of making the dead seem not quite so dead shaking hands that was one way by slighting death by acting we pretended it was not the terrible thing it was by our language which was both hard and wistful we transformed the bodies into piles of waste thus when someone got killed as curt lemon did his body was not really a body but rather one small bit of waste in the midst of a much wider wastage i learned that words make a difference it s easier to cope with a kicked bucket than a corpse if it isn t human it doesn t matter much if it s dead and so a vc nurse fried by napalm was a crispy critter a vietnamese baby which lay nearby was a roasted peanut just a crunchie munchie rat kiley said as he stepped over the body we kept the dead alive with stories when ted lavender was shot in the head the men talked about how they d never seen him so mellow how tranquil he was how it wasn t the bullet but the tranquilizers that blew his mind he wasn t dead just laidback there were christians among us like kiowa who believed in the new testament stories of life after death other stories were passed down like legends from oldtimer to newcomer mostly though we had to make up our own often they were exaggerated or blatant lies but it was a way of bringing body and soul back together or a way of making new bodies for the souls to inhabit there was a story for instance about how curt lemon had gone trickortreating on halloween a dark spooky night and so lemon put on a ghost mask and painted up his body all different colors and crept across a paddy to a sleeping villagealmost stark naked the story went just boots and balls and an m16and in the dark lemon went from hootch to hootchringing doorbells he called itand a few hours later when he slipped back into the perimeter he had a whole sackful of goodies to share with his pals candles and joss sticks and a pair of black pajamas and statuettes of the smiling buddha that was the story anyway other versions were much more elaborate full of descriptions and scraps of dialogue rat kiley liked to spice it up with extra details see what happens is it s like four in the morning and lemon sneaks into a hootch with that weird ghost mask on everybody s asleep right so he wakes up this cute little mamasan tickles her foot  hey mama san  he goes real soft like  hey mamasantrick or treat  should ve seen her face about freaks i mean there s this buck naked ghost standing there and he s got this m16 up against her ear and he whispers  hey mamasan trick or fuckin  treat  then he takes off her pj s strips her right down sticks the pajamas in his sack and tucks her into bed and heads for the next hootch pausing a moment rat kiley would grin and shake his head honest to god he d murmur trick or treat lemonthere s one class act to listen to the story especially as rat kiley told it you d never know that curt lemon was dead he was still out there in the dark naked and painted up trickortreating sliding from hootch to hootch in that crazy white ghost mask but he was dead in september the day after linda died i asked my father to take me down to benson s funeral home to view the body i was a fifth grader then i was curious on the drive downtown my father kept his eyes straight ahead at one point i remember he made a scratchy sound in his throat it took him a long time to light up a cigarette timmy he said you re sure about this i nodded at him down inside of course i wasn t sure and yet i had to see her one more time what i needed i suppose was some sort of final confirmation something to carry with me after she was gone  when we parked in front of the funeral home my father turned and looked at me if this bothers you he said just say the word we ll make a quick getaway fair enough okay i said or if you start to feel sick or anything i won t i told him inside the first thing i noticed was the smell thick and sweet like something sprayed out of a can the viewing room was empty except for linda and my father and me i felt a rush of panic as we walked up the aisle the smell made me dizzy i tried to fight it off slowing down a little taking short shallow breaths through my mouth but at the same time i felt a funny excitement anticipation in a waythat same awkward feeling when i walked up the sidewalk to ring her doorbell on our first date i wanted to impress her i wanted something to happen between us a secret signal of some sort the room was dimly lighted almost dark but at the far end of the aisle linda s white casket was illuminated by a row of spotlights up in the ceiling everything was quiet my father put his hand on my shoulder whispered something and backed off after a moment i edged forward a few steps pushing up on my toes for a better look it didn t seem real a mistake i thought the girl lying in the white casket wasn t linda there was a resemblance maybe but where linda had always been very slender and fragilelooking almost skinny the body in that casket was fat and swollen for a second i wondered if somebody had made a terrible blunder a technical mistake like they d pumped her too full of formaldehyde or embalming fluid or whatever they used her arms and face were bloated the skin at her cheeks was stretched out tight like the rubber skin on a balloon just before it pops open even her fingers seemed puffy i turned and glanced behind me where my father stood thinking that maybe it was a jokehoping it was a jokealmost believing that linda would jump out from behind one of the curtains and laugh and yell out my name but she didn t the room was silent when i looked back at the casket i felt dizzy again in my heart i m sure i knew this was linda but even so i couldn t find much to recognize i tried to pretend she was taking a nap her hands folded at her stomach just sleeping away the afternoon except she didn t look asleep she looked dead she looked heavy and totally dead  i remember closing my eyes after a while my father stepped up beside me come on now he said let s go get some ice cream in the months after ted lavender died there were many other bodies i never shook handsnot thatbut one afternoon i climbed a tree and threw down what was left of curt lemon i watched my friend kiowa sink into the muck along the song tra bong and in early july after a battle in the mountains i was assigned to a sixman detail to police up the enemy kias there were twentyseven bodies altogether and parts of several others the dead were everywhere some lay in piles some lay alone one i remember seemed to kneel another was bent from the waist over a small boulder the top of his head on the ground his arms rigid the eyes squinting in concentration as if he were about to perform a handstand or somersault it was my worst day at the war for three hours we carried the bodies down the mountain to a clearing alongside a narrow dirt road we had lunch there then a truck pulled up and we worked in twoman teams to load the truck i remember swinging the bodies up mitchell sanders took a man s feet i took the arms and we counted to three working up momentum and then we tossed the body high and watched it bounce and come to rest among the other bodies the dead had been dead for more than a day they were all badly bloated their clothing was stretched tight like sausage skins and when we picked them up some made sharp burping sounds as the gases were released they were heavy their feet were bluish green and cold the smell was terrible at one point mitchell sanders looked at me and said hey man i just realized something what he wiped his eyes and spoke very quietly as if awed by his own wisdom death sucks he said lying in bed at night i made up elaborate stories to bring linda alive in my sleep i invented my own dreams it sounds impossible i know but i did it i d picture somebody s birthday partya crowded room i d think and a big chocolate cake with pink candlesand then soon i d be dreaming it and after a while linda would show up as i knew she would and in the dream we d look at each other and not talk much because we were shy but then later i d walk her home and we d sit on her front steps and stare at the dark and just be together she d say amazing things sometimes once you re alive she d say you can t ever be dead or she d say do i look dead it was a kind of selfhypnosis partly willpower partly faith which is how stories arrive but back then it felt like a miracle my dreams had become a secret meeting place and in the weeks after she died i couldn t wait to fall asleep at night i began going to bed earlier and earlier sometimes even in bright daylight my mother i remember finally asked about it at breakfast one morning timmy what s wrong she said but all i could do was shrug and say nothing i just need sleep that s all i didn t dare tell the truth it was embarrassing i suppose but it was also a precious secret like a magic trick where if i tried to explain it or even talk about it the thrill and mystery would be gone i didn t want to lose linda she was dead i understood that after all i d seen her body and yet even as a nineyearold i had begun to practice the magic of stories some i just dreamed up others i wrote downthe scenes and dialogue and at nighttime i d slide into sleep knowing that linda would be there waiting for me once i remember we went ice skating late at night tracing loops and circles under yellow floodlights later we sat by a wood stove in the warming house all alone and after a while i asked her what it was like to be dead apparently linda thought it was a silly question she smiled and said do i look dead i told her no she looked terrific i waited a moment then asked again and linda made a soft little sigh i could smell our wool mittens drying on the stove for a few seconds she was quiet well right now she said i m not dead but when i am it s like  i don t know i guess it s like being inside a book that nobody s reading a book i said an old one it s up on a library shelf so you re safe and everything but the book hasn t been checked out for a long long time all you can do is wait just hope somebody ll pick it up and start reading linda smiled at me  anyhow it s not so bad she said i mean when you re dead you just have to be yourself she stood up and put on her red stocking cap this is stupid let s go skate some more so i followed her down to the frozen pond it was late and nobody else was there and we held hands and skated almost all night under the yellow lights and then it becomes 1990 i m fortythree years old and a writer now still dreaming linda alive in exactly the same way she s not the embodied linda she s mostly made up with a new identity and a new name like the man who never was her real name doesn t matter she was nine years old i loved her and then she died and yet right here in the spell of memory and imagination i can still see her as if through ice as if i m gazing into some other world a place where there are no brain tumors and no funeral homes where there are no bodies at all i can see kiowa too and ted lavender and curt lemon and sometimes i can even see timmy skating with linda under the yellow floodlights i m young and happy i ll never die i m skimming across the surface of my own history moving fast riding the melt beneath the blades doing loops and spins and when i take a high leap into the dark and come down thirty years later i realize it is as tim trying to save timmy s life with a story but this too is true stories can save us i m fortythree years old and a writer now and even still right here i keep dreaming linda alive and ted lavender too and kiowa and curt lemon and a slim young man i killed and an old man sprawled beside a pigpen and several others whose bodies i once lifted and dumped into a truck they re all dead but in a story which is a kind of dreaming the dead sometimes smile and sit up and return to the world start here a body without a name on an afternoon in 1969 the platoon took sniper fire from a filthy little village along the south china sea it lasted only a minute or two and nobody was hurt but even so lieutenant jimmy cross got on the radio and ordered up an air strike for the next half hour we watched the place burn it was a cool bright morning like early autumn and the jets were glossy black against the sky when it ended we formed into a loose line and swept east through the village it was all wreckage i remember the smell of burnt straw i remember broken fences and tornup trees and heaps of stone and brick and pottery the place was desertedno people no animalsand the only confirmed kill was an old man who lay faceup near a pigpen at the center of the village his right arm was gone at his face there were already many flies and gnats dave jensen went over and shook the old man s hand howdee doo he said one by one the others did it too they didn t disturb the body they just grabbed the old man s hand and offered a few words and moved away rat kiley bent over the corpse gimme five he said a real honor pleased as punch said henry dobbins i was brandnew to the war it was my fourth day i hadn t yet developed a sense of humor right away as if i d swallowed something i felt a moist sickness rise up in my throat i sat down beside the pigpen closed my eyes put my head between my knees after a moment dave jensen touched my shoulder be polite now he said go introduce yourself nothing to be afraid about just a nice old man show a little respect for your elders no way maybe it s too real for you that s right i said way too real jensen kept after me but i didn t go near the body i didn t even look at it except by accident for the rest of the day there was still that sickness inside me but it wasn t the old man s corpse so much it was that awesome act of greeting the dead at one point i remember they sat the body up against a fence they crossed his legs and talked to him the guest of honor mitchell sanders said and he placed a can of orange slices in the old man s lap vitamin c he said gently a guy s health that s the most important thing they proposed toasts they lifted their canteens and drank to the old man s family and ancestors his many grandchildren his newfound life after death it was more than mockery there was a formality to it like a funeral without the sadness dave jensen flicked his eyes at me hey o brien he said you got a toast in mind never too late for manners i found things to do with my hands i looked away and tried not to think late in the afternoon just before dusk kiowa came up and asked if he could sit at my foxhole for a minute he offered me a christmas cookie from a batch his father had sent him it was february now but the cookies tasted fine for a few moments kiowa watched the sky you did a good thing today he said that shaking hands crap it isn t decent the guys ll hassle you for a whileespecially jensenbut just keep saying no should ve done it myself takes guts i know that it wasn t guts i was scared kiowa shrugged same difference  no i couldn t do it a mental block or something    i don t know just creepy well you re new here you ll get used to it he paused for a second studying the green and red sprinkles on a cookie todayi guess this was your first look at a real body i shook my head all day long i d been picturing linda s face the way she smiled it sounds funny i said but that poor old man he reminds me of i mean there s this girl i used to know i took her to the movies once my first date kiowa looked at me for a long while then he leaned back and smiled man he said that s a bad date linda was nine then as i was but we were in love and it was real when i write about her now three decades later it s tempting to dismiss it as a crush an infatuation of childhood but i know for a fact that what we felt for each other was as deep and rich as love can ever get it had all the shadings and complexities of mature adult love and maybe more because there were not yet words for it and because it was not yet fixed to comparisons or chronologies or the ways by which adults measure such things i just loved her she had poise and great dignity her eyes i remember were deep brown like her hair and she was slender and very quiet and fragile looking even then at nine years old i wanted to live inside her body i wanted to melt into her bonesthat kind of love and so in the spring of 1956 when we were in the fourth grade i took her out on the first real date of my lifea double date actually with my mother and father though i can t remember the exact sequence my mother had somehow arranged it with linda s parents and on that damp spring night my dad did the driving while linda and i sat in the back seat and stared out opposite windows both of us trying to pretend it was nothing special for me though it was very special down inside i had important things to tell her big profound things but i couldn t make any words come out i had trouble breathing now and then i d glance over at her thinking how beautiful she was her white skin and those dark brown eyes and the way she always smiled at the worldalways it seemedas if her face had been designed that way the smile never went away that night i remember she wore a new red cap which seemed to me very stylish and sophisticated very unusual it was a stocking cap basically except the tapered part at the top seemed extra long almost too long like a tail growing out of the back of her head it made me think of the caps that santa s elves wear the same shape and color the same fuzzy white tassel at the tip sitting there in the back seat i wanted to find some way to let her know how i felt a compliment of some sort but all i could manage was a stupid comment about the cap jeez i must ve said what a cap linda smiled at the windowshe knew what i meantbut my mother turned and gave me a hard look it surprised me it was as if i d brought up some horrible secret for the rest of the ride i kept my mouth shut we parked in front of the ben franklin store and walked up main street toward the state theater my parents went first side by side and then linda in her new red cap and then me tailing along ten or twenty steps behind i was nine years old i didn t yet have the gift for small talk now and then my mother glanced back making little motions with her hand to speed me up at the ticket booth i remember linda stood off to one side i moved over to the concession area studying the candy and both of us were very careful to avoid the awkwardness of eye contact which was how we knew about being in love it was pure knowing neither of us i suppose would ve thought to use that word love but by the fact of not looking at each other and not talking we understood with a clarity beyond language that we were sharing something huge and permanent behind me in the theater i heard cartoon music hey step it up i said i almost had the courage to look at her you want popcorn or what the thing about a story is that you dream it as you tell it hoping that others might then dream along with you and in this way memory and imagination and language combine to make spirits in the head there is the illusion of aliveness in vietnam for instance ted lavender had a habit of popping four or five tranquilizers every morning it was his way of coping just dealing with the realities and the drugs helped to ease him through the days i remember how peaceful his eyes were even in bad situations he had a soft dreamy expression on his face which was what he wanted a kind of escape how s the war today somebody would ask and ted lavender would give a little smile to the sky and say mellowa nice smooth war today and then in april he was shot in the head outside the village of than khe kiowa and i and a couple of others were ordered to prepare his body for the dustoff i remember squatting down not wanting to look but then looking lavender s left cheekbone was gone there was a swollen blackness around his eye quickly trying not to feel anything we went through the kid s pockets i remember wishing i had gloves it wasn t the blood i hated it was the deadness we put his personal effects in a plastic bag and tied the bag to his arm we stripped off the canteens and ammo all the heavy stuff and wrapped him up in his own poncho and carried him out to a dry paddy and laid him down for a while nobody said much then mitchell sanders laughed and looked over at the green plastic poncho hey lavender he said how s the war today there was a short quiet mellow somebody said well that s good sanders murmured that s real real good stay cool now hey no sweat i m mellow just ease on back then don t need no pills we got this incredible chopper on call this once in a lifetime mindtrip oh yeahmellow mitchell sanders smiled there it is my man this chopper gonna take you up high and cool gonna relax you gonna alter your whole perspective on this sorry sorry shit we could almost see ted lavender s dreamy blue eyes we could almost hear him roger that somebody said i m ready to fly there was the sound of the wind the sound of birds and the quiet afternoon which was the world we were in  that s what a story does the bodies are animated you make the dead talk they sometimes say things like roger that or they say timmy stop crying which is what linda said to me after she was dead even now i can see her walking down the aisle of the old state theater in worthington minnesota i can see her face in profile beside me the cheeks softly lighted by coming attractions the movie that night was the man who never was i remember the plot clearly or at least the premise because the main character was a corpse that fact alone i know deeply impressed me it was a world war two film the allies devise a scheme to mislead germany about the site of the upcoming landings in europe they get their hands on a bodya british soldier i believe they dress him up in an officer s uniform plant fake documents in his pockets then dump him in the sea and let the currents wash him onto a nazi beach the germans find the documents the deception wins the war even now i can remember the awful splash as that corpse fell into the sea i remember glancing over at linda thinking it might be too much for her but in the dim gray light she seemed to be smiling at the screen there were little crinkles at her eyes her lips open and gently curving at the corners i couldn t understand it there was nothing to smile at once or twice in fact i had to close my eyes but it didn t help much even then i kept seeing the soldier s body tumbling toward the water splashing down hard how inert and heavy it was how completely dead it was a relief when the movie finally ended afterward we drove out to the dairy queen at the edge of town the night had a quilted weighteddown quality as if somehow burdened and all around us the minnesota prairies reached out in long repetitive waves of corn and soybeans everything flat everything the same i remember eating ice cream in the back seat of the buick and a long blank drive in the dark and then pulling up in front of linda s house things must ve been said but it s all gone now except for a few last images i remember walking her to the front door i remember the brass porch light with its fierce yellow glow my own feet the juniper bushes along the front steps the wet grass linda close beside me we were in love nine years old yes but it was real love and now we were alone on those front steps finally we looked at each other bye i said  linda nodded and said bye over the next few weeks linda wore her new red cap to school every day she never took it off not even in the classroom and so it was inevitable that she took some teasing about it most of it came from a kid named nick veenhof out on the playground during recess nick would creep up behind her and make a grab for the cap almost yanking it off then scampering away it went on like that for weeks the girls giggling the guys egging him on naturally i wanted to do something about it but it just wasn t possible i had my reputation to think about i had my pride and there was also the problem of nick veenhof so i stood off to the side just a spectator wishing i could do things i couldn t do i watched linda clamp down the cap with the palm of her hand holding it there smiling over in nick s direction as if none of it really mattered for me though it did matter it still does i should ve stepped in fourth grade is no excuse besides it doesn t get easier with time and twelve years later when vietnam presented much harder choices some practice at being brave might ve helped a little also too i might ve stopped what happened next maybe not but at least it s possible most of the details i ve forgotten or maybe blocked out but i know it was an afternoon in late spring and we were taking a spelling test and halfway into it nick veenhof held up his hand and asked to use the pencil sharpener right away the kids laughed no doubt he d broken the pencil on purpose but it wasn t something you could prove and so the teacher nodded and told him to hustle it up which was a mistake out of nowhere nick developed a terrible limp he moved in slow motion dragging himself up to the pencil sharpener and carefully slipping in his pencil and then grinding away forever at the time i suppose it was funny but on the way back to his seat nick took a short detour he squeezed between two desks turned sharply right and moved up the aisle toward linda i saw him grin at one of his pals in a way i already knew what was coming as he passed linda s desk he dropped the pencil and squatted down to get it when he came up his left hand slipped behind her back there was a halfsecond hesitation maybe he was trying to stop himself maybe then just briefly he felt some small approximation of guilt but it wasn t enough he took hold of the white tassel stood up and gently lifted off her cap somebody must ve laughed i remember a short tinny echo i remember nick veenhof trying to smile somewhere behind me a girl said uh or a sound like that linda didn t move even now when i think back on it i can still see the glossy whiteness of her scalp she wasn t bald not quite not completely there were some tufts of hair little patches of grayish brown fuzz but what i saw then and keep seeing now is all that whiteness a smooth pale translucent white i could see the bones and veins i could see the exact structure of her skull there was a large bandaid at the back of her head a row of black stitches a piece of gauze taped above her left ear nick veenhof took a step backward he was still smiling but the smile was doing strange things the whole time linda stared straight ahead her eyes locked on the blackboard her hands loosely folded at her lap she didn t say anything after a time though she turned and looked at me across the room it lasted only a moment but i had the feeling that a whole conversation was happening between us well she was saying and i was saying sure okay later on she cried for a while the teacher helped her put the cap back on then we finished the spelling test and did some fingerpainting and after school that day nick veenhof and i walked her home it s now 1990 i m fortythree years old which would ve seemed impossible to a fourth grader and yet when i look at photographs of myself as i was in 1956 i realize that in the important ways i haven t changed at all i was timmy then now i m tim but the essence remains the same i m not fooled by the baggy pants or the crew cut or the happy smilei know my own eyesand there is no doubt that the timmy smiling at the camera is the tim i am now inside the body or beyond the body there is something absolute and unchanging the human life is all one thing like a blade tracing loops on ice a little kid a twentythree yearold infantry sergeant a middleaged writer knowing guilt and sorrow and as a writer now i want to save linda s life not her bodyher life  she died of course nine years old and she died it was a brain tumor she lived through the summer and into the first part of september and then she was dead but in a story i can steal her soul i can revive at least briefly that which is absolute and unchanging in a story miracles can happen linda can smile and sit up she can reach out touch my wrist and say timmy stop crying i needed that kind of miracle at some point i had come to understand that linda was sick maybe even dying but i loved her and just couldn t accept it in the middle of the summer i remember my mother tried to explain to me about brain tumors now and then she said bad things start growing inside us sometimes you can cut them out and other times you can t and for linda it was one of the times when you can t i thought about it for several days all right i finally said so will she get better now well no my mother said i don t think so she stared at a spot behind my shoulder sometimes people don t ever get better they die sometimes i shook my head not linda i said but on a september afternoon during noon recess nick veenhof came up to me on the school playground your girlfriend he said she kicked the bucket at first i didn t understand she s dead he said my mom told me at lunchtime no lie she actually kicked the goddang bucket all i could do was nod somehow it didn t quite register i turned away glanced down at my hands for a second then walked home without telling anyone it was a little after one o clock i remember and the house was empty i drank some chocolate milk and then lay down on the sofa in the living room not really sad just floating trying to imagine what it was to be dead nothing much came to me i remember closing my eyes and whispering her name almost begging trying to make her come back linda i said please and then i concentrated i willed her alive it was a dream i suppose or a daydream but i made it happen i saw her coming down the middle of main street all alone it was nearly dark and the street was deserted no cars or people and linda wore a pink dress and shiny black shoes i remember sitting down on the curb to watch all her hair had grown back the scars and stitches were gone in the dream if that s what it was she was playing a game of some sort laughing and running up the empty street kicking a big aluminum water bucket right then i started to cry after a moment linda stopped and carried her water bucket over to the curb and asked why i was so sad well god i said you re dead linda nodded at me she was standing under a yellow streetlight a nineyearold girl just a kid and yet there was something ageless in her eyesnot a child not an adultjust a bright ongoing everness that same pinprick of absolute lasting light that i see today in my own eyes as timmy smiles at tim from the graying photographs of that time dead i said linda smiled it was a secret smile as if she knew things nobody could ever know and she reached out and touched my wrist and said timmy stop crying it doesn t matter in vietnam too we had ways of making the dead seem not quite so dead shaking hands that was one way by slighting death by acting we pretended it was not the terrible thing it was by our language which was both hard and wistful we transformed the bodies into piles of waste thus when someone got killed as curt lemon did his body was not really a body but rather one small bit of waste in the midst of a much wider wastage i learned that words make a difference it s easier to cope with a kicked bucket than a corpse if it isn t human it doesn t matter much if it s dead and so a vc nurse fried by napalm was a crispy critter a vietnamese baby which lay nearby was a roasted peanut just a crunchie munchie rat kiley said as he stepped over the body we kept the dead alive with stories when ted lavender was shot in the head the men talked about how they d never seen him so mellow how tranquil he was how it wasn t the bullet but the tranquilizers that blew his mind he wasn t dead just laidback there were christians among us like kiowa who believed in the new testament stories of life after death other stories were passed down like legends from oldtimer to newcomer mostly though we had to make up our own often they were exaggerated or blatant lies but it was a way of bringing body and soul back together or a way of making new bodies for the souls to inhabit there was a story for instance about how curt lemon had gone trickortreating on halloween a dark spooky night and so lemon put on a ghost mask and painted up his body all different colors and crept across a paddy to a sleeping villagealmost stark naked the story went just boots and balls and an m16and in the dark lemon went from hootch to hootchringing doorbells he called itand a few hours later when he slipped back into the perimeter he had a whole sackful of goodies to share with his pals candles and joss sticks and a pair of black pajamas and statuettes of the smiling buddha that was the story anyway other versions were much more elaborate full of descriptions and scraps of dialogue rat kiley liked to spice it up with extra details see what happens is it s like four in the morning and lemon sneaks into a hootch with that weird ghost mask on everybody s asleep right so he wakes up this cute little mamasan tickles her foot  hey mama san  he goes real soft like  hey mamasantrick or treat  should ve seen her face about freaks i mean there s this buck naked ghost standing there and he s got this m16 up against her ear and he whispers  hey mamasan trick or fuckin  treat  then he takes off her pj s strips her right down sticks the pajamas in his sack and tucks her into bed and heads for the next hootch pausing a moment rat kiley would grin and shake his head honest to god he d murmur trick or treat lemonthere s one class act to listen to the story especially as rat kiley told it you d never know that curt lemon was dead he was still out there in the dark naked and painted up trickortreating sliding from hootch to hootch in that crazy white ghost mask but he was dead in september the day after linda died i asked my father to take me down to benson s funeral home to view the body i was a fifth grader then i was curious on the drive downtown my father kept his eyes straight ahead at one point i remember he made a scratchy sound in his throat it took him a long time to light up a cigarette timmy he said you re sure about this i nodded at him down inside of course i wasn t sure and yet i had to see her one more time what i needed i suppose was some sort of final confirmation something to carry with me after she was gone  when we parked in front of the funeral home my father turned and looked at me if this bothers you he said just say the word we ll make a quick getaway fair enough okay i said or if you start to feel sick or anything i won t i told him inside the first thing i noticed was the smell thick and sweet like something sprayed out of a can the viewing room was empty except for linda and my father and me i felt a rush of panic as we walked up the aisle the smell made me dizzy i tried to fight it off slowing down a little taking short shallow breaths through my mouth but at the same time i felt a funny excitement anticipation in a waythat same awkward feeling when i walked up the sidewalk to ring her doorbell on our first date i wanted to impress her i wanted something to happen between us a secret signal of some sort the room was dimly lighted almost dark but at the far end of the aisle linda s white casket was illuminated by a row of spotlights up in the ceiling everything was quiet my father put his hand on my shoulder whispered something and backed off after a moment i edged forward a few steps pushing up on my toes for a better look it didn t seem real a mistake i thought the girl lying in the white casket wasn t linda there was a resemblance maybe but where linda had always been very slender and fragilelooking almost skinny the body in that casket was fat and swollen for a second i wondered if somebody had made a terrible blunder a technical mistake like they d pumped her too full of formaldehyde or embalming fluid or whatever they used her arms and face were bloated the skin at her cheeks was stretched out tight like the rubber skin on a balloon just before it pops open even her fingers seemed puffy i turned and glanced behind me where my father stood thinking that maybe it was a jokehoping it was a jokealmost believing that linda would jump out from behind one of the curtains and laugh and yell out my name but she didn t the room was silent when i looked back at the casket i felt dizzy again in my heart i m sure i knew this was linda but even so i couldn t find much to recognize i tried to pretend she was taking a nap her hands folded at her stomach just sleeping away the afternoon except she didn t look asleep she looked dead she looked heavy and totally dead  i remember closing my eyes after a while my father stepped up beside me come on now he said let s go get some ice cream in the months after ted lavender died there were many other bodies i never shook handsnot thatbut one afternoon i climbed a tree and threw down what was left of curt lemon i watched my friend kiowa sink into the muck along the song tra bong and in early july after a battle in the mountains i was assigned to a sixman detail to police up the enemy kias there were twentyseven bodies altogether and parts of several others the dead were everywhere some lay in piles some lay alone one i remember seemed to kneel another was bent from the waist over a small boulder the top of his head on the ground his arms rigid the eyes squinting in concentration as if he were about to perform a handstand or somersault it was my worst day at the war for three hours we carried the bodies down the mountain to a clearing alongside a narrow dirt road we had lunch there then a truck pulled up and we worked in twoman teams to load the truck i remember swinging the bodies up mitchell sanders took a man s feet i took the arms and we counted to three working up momentum and then we tossed the body high and watched it bounce and come to rest among the other bodies the dead had been dead for more than a day they were all badly bloated their clothing was stretched tight like sausage skins and when we picked them up some made sharp burping sounds as the gases were released they were heavy their feet were bluish green and cold the smell was terrible at one point mitchell sanders looked at me and said hey man i just realized something what he wiped his eyes and spoke very quietly as if awed by his own wisdom death sucks he said lying in bed at night i made up elaborate stories to bring linda alive in my sleep i invented my own dreams it sounds impossible i know but i did it i d picture somebody s birthday partya crowded room i d think and a big chocolate cake with pink candlesand then soon i d be dreaming it and after a while linda would show up as i knew she would and in the dream we d look at each other and not talk much because we were shy but then later i d walk her home and we d sit on her front steps and stare at the dark and just be together she d say amazing things sometimes once you re alive she d say you can t ever be dead or she d say do i look dead it was a kind of selfhypnosis partly willpower partly faith which is how stories arrive but back then it felt like a miracle my dreams had become a secret meeting place and in the weeks after she died i couldn t wait to fall asleep at night i began going to bed earlier and earlier sometimes even in bright daylight my mother i remember finally asked about it at breakfast one morning timmy what s wrong she said but all i could do was shrug and say nothing i just need sleep that s all i didn t dare tell the truth it was embarrassing i suppose but it was also a precious secret like a magic trick where if i tried to explain it or even talk about it the thrill and mystery would be gone i didn t want to lose linda she was dead i understood that after all i d seen her body and yet even as a nineyearold i had begun to practice the magic of stories some i just dreamed up others i wrote downthe scenes and dialogue and at nighttime i d slide into sleep knowing that linda would be there waiting for me once i remember we went ice skating late at night tracing loops and circles under yellow floodlights later we sat by a wood stove in the warming house all alone and after a while i asked her what it was like to be dead apparently linda thought it was a silly question she smiled and said do i look dead i told her no she looked terrific i waited a moment then asked again and linda made a soft little sigh i could smell our wool mittens drying on the stove for a few seconds she was quiet well right now she said i m not dead but when i am it s like  i don t know i guess it s like being inside a book that nobody s reading a book i said an old one it s up on a library shelf so you re safe and everything but the book hasn t been checked out for a long long time all you can do is wait just hope somebody ll pick it up and start reading linda smiled at me  anyhow it s not so bad she said i mean when you re dead you just have to be yourself she stood up and put on her red stocking cap this is stupid let s go skate some more so i followed her down to the frozen pond it was late and nobody else was there and we held hands and skated almost all night under the yellow lights and then it becomes 1990 i m fortythree years old and a writer now still dreaming linda alive in exactly the same way she s not the embodied linda she s mostly made up with a new identity and a new name like the man who never was her real name doesn t matter she was nine years old i loved her and then she died and yet right here in the spell of memory and imagination i can still see her as if through ice as if i m gazing into some other world a place where there are no brain tumors and no funeral homes where there are no bodies at all i can see kiowa too and ted lavender and curt lemon and sometimes i can even see timmy skating with linda under the yellow floodlights i m young and happy i ll never die i m skimming across the surface of my own history moving fast riding the melt beneath the blades doing loops and spins and when i take a high leap into the dark and come down thirty years later i realize it is as tim trying to save timmy s life with a story

 every day that i wake up i wake up in a nightmare every day that i wake up i can never see quite clear when i look at my surroundings and everybody still doubts me i wanna live to hear a crowd sing all my lyrics so loudly i miss the time when we would all get together i guess it s fine but i really wish that we were better real talk sipping drinks without all the pressure now everybody needs to think about posting whatever and people ask how i m doing i ve never been better that s really not a conversation i m willing to enter how come we all continue forcing out all this pressure i m just sick of these opinions and all of these lectures   i need my space now so i can feel nothing i live this nightmare so i can be something i do what i love and hope you will love me i face this nightmare no i am not running   i m scared of being rich i m scared of being poor i m scared of being lonely but i m scared of being bored sometimes i get really angry and i don t know why sometimes i really do hate me can t even pick my own side yeah what is even going on why the hell do i even write songs what the hell am i doing here man i guess i don t understand a thing damn yeah but maybe ignorance is bliss yo i d rather lay in the abyss than be aware of what i missed especially if i quit yeah they say that hell is your last day when you see what you could ve became that day would drive me insane so i intend on staying my lane yeah i picked a path and i picked the pain yeah i want it bad that won t ever change yeah sometimes i m mad sometimes i m okay yeah i know i ll have what

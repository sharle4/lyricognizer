ordered champagne and flowers and you re not even dressed tonight s a special night to remember with pride these twenty happy years since you became my bride it is all too absurd you re so cross and abrupt but i don t say a word or you re bound to erupt your peculiar moods i ve experienced before so i ll pour another drink and quietly pace the floor it s a quarter to eight as we fretfully wait for your little black dress that was promised by six is it just rotten luck when we re doing the town that the fates should conspire to let us mortals down i have seats for a show and it s opening night my shoes do not fit me and my suit is too tight and you sit there and curse an occasional curse and i ve got a headache that s quickly getting worse happy anniversary happy anniversary they deliver your frock but you re still in distress it was past nine o clock when i helped you to dress i tried to do you up but it wasn t my day for then to fill my cup your zipper stuck half way i got all in a sweat over anxious and vexed will i ever forget the thing that happened next your dress just came apart with one terrible tear your disappointed cries were more than i could bear at eleven at last when we got into town we arrived at the show but the curtain was down i suggested a bite no no you wanted to walk you had no appetite and no desire to talk so we strolled for an hour and the evening was sweet and i bought you a flower from a man in the street and we kissed on the sidewalk without reason or rhyme and we knew that our love is must stronger than time happy anniversary happy anniversary happy anniversar

the shadows of the night surround me alone i face my destiny to die of love they say our love has been forbidden but what we feel can not be hidden it s very possible you see to die of love to die of love how to live far forever with you just to live life together with you that s the choice that i make and a chance i must take to live my love must find expression and so i make my last confession without you it s my destiny to die of love this world of ours does not grow younger some die of illness some of hunger i stand before eternity to die of love that s why i try to find a way now i only live from day to day now and yet it s possible you see to die of love to die of love how to live far forever with you just to live life together with you that s the choice that i make and a chance i must take i hear their whispers when they see us if all their words condemn or free us i wonder will they sentence me to die of love to die of love to die of lov

you it unnerves you you lose your wits he he ignites you with eyes of flame you it excites you you like the game and i in my chair though i hardly speak i notice each innuendo and i in my chair i m stricken with fear at seeing the end so near he out to win you he woos with style you you continue to coyly smile he with his quarry on hunting ground you only sorry that i m around and i in my chair though i hardly speak i see just how well he s doing and i in my chair i m trying to hide the dread that i hold inside he his eyes flatter your glances touch you now you chatter a bit too much he like a gypsy he serenades you you grow tipsy your laugh cascades and i in my chair though i hardly speak my heart s on the verge of crying and i in my chair my heart understands my love is now changing hands no no it s nothing perhaps a little tired only not at all why do you ask on the contrary this was a beautiful evening yes indeed a beautiful evening

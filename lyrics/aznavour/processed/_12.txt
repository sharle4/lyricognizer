a great apartment is our home in fairhome towers i have to keep me company two dogs a cat a parakeet some plants and flowers i help my mother with the chores i wash she dries i do the floors we work together i shop and cook and sow a bit though mum does too i must admit i do it better at night i work in a strange bar impersonating every star i m quite deceiving the customers come in with doubt and wonder what i m all about but leave believing i do a very special show where i am nude from head to toe after stripteasing each night the men look so surprised i change my sex before their eyes tell me if you can what makes a man a man at three o clock or so i meet with friends to have a bite to eat and conversation we love to empty out our hearts with every subject from the arts to liberation we love to pull apart someone and spread some gossip just for fun or start a rumor we let our hair down so to speak and mock ourselves with tongue in cheek and inside humor so many times we have to pay for having fun and being gay it s not amusing there s always those that spoil our games by finding fault and calling names always accusing they draw attention to themselves at the expense of someone else it s so confusing yet they make fun of how i talk and imitate the way i walk tell me if you can what makes a man a man my masquerade comes to an end and i go home to bed again alone and friendless i close my eyes i think of him i fantasize what might have been my dreams are endless we love each other but it seems the love is only in my dreams it s so one sided but in this life i must confess the search for love and happiness is unrequited i ask myself what i have got of what i am and what i m not what have i given the answers come from those who make the rules that some of us must break just to keep living i know my life is not a crime i m just a victim of my time i stand defenseless nobody has the right to be the judge of what is right for me tell me if you can what make a man a man tell me if you can tell me if you can tell me if you can what makes a man a man

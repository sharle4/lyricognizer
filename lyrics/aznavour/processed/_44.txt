my love i wish there was another way to say the thing i want to say and not to have to say i love you another way to make a start to tell you what is in my heart and how my every thought is of you to find a phrase that says as well the secret that i long to tell ive scanned the dictionarys pages but back to i love you ill go eight little letters in a row that men have spoken through the ages i love you i love you we say it in the songs we sing we re read it in the things of spring or as the ps of a letter a little cliche quickly said familiar as our daily bread yet nothing seems to say it better i might have said a hundred things my phrases might have taken wings free the world or region hold and clever but every time i seem to stall or three small words to say it all three little words that spell forever ill shout it from the highest roof ill carve it in the trunks of trees ill tell the whispering breeze about you i can not hide it anymore i can not say it any less i might as well confess i love you my love i love you my lov

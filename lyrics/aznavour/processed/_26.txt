the ambitions frustrated that no longer survive i drink day after day to the chaos behind me yes i drink to remind me that still i m alive so i give you a toast to the endless confusions to the lies and delusions that have swallowed my life yes i give you a toast to the wine and the roses to the deadly cirrhosis that can cut like a knife i drink to catch a gleam of the love we degraded of a life that has faded like the vanishing moon i drink as in a dream to my waning desire to the passionate fire that has burned out so soon i drink and i drown in the promise you made me all the times you betrayed me in your anger and spite when you took on the town when you looked for the action when you took satisfaction like a whore in the night i drink to make believe that my life is worth living that the gods are forgiving at the end of the day i drink because i grieve for the dreams when we started for the innocent hearted who got lost on the way for the children unborn for their dead phantom faces for our sterile embraces in the tomb of your bed i drink and i mourn for the harvest that failed for the ship that has sailed for the hope that is dead i drink to find a place where the darkness can hide me till the terror inside me can at last disappear i drink to my disgrace till oblivion claims me till there s nothing that shames me till i m blind to my fear yes i drink till i burst in my own degradation to the edge of damnation that is waiting below yes i drink with a thirst that destroys and depraves me and cuffs and enslaves me and will never let go i drink until i m lost and the street is my hideout where i vomit my pride out till i m gasping for breath i drink to count the cost of a life i despair for until god hears my prayer for the compassion of death so i spit out my bile at the gods who demean us at the silence between us at the love none can save for a life that is vile for a soul that is ailing for a body that s failing as it heads for the grave i drink without a care drink because i must drink to my despair i drink to your disgust i drink drink drink by god i drink yes i drink

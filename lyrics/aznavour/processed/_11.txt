is all that i own i see boats coming in with the fruits of places unknown i watch as they come from the world in the sun and i see in my mind that there is farewell to this cold golden hell they can leave far behind let me go where they go let me fly the winds that they fly for to stay in this place will destroy a man s certain life take me along a long way from here take me along to a far away shore when you re poor it s easy to bare with sunshine and soft summer air at the end of the day in a bar with sailors i stand and i talk about girls about love a glass in my hand then in my dreams i can travel at seas on a float southern bound there i can hold all the magic in gold of the love i have found when the bars on the quayside are closed alone i remain i continue to dream and each night the dream is the same take me along a long way from here take me along to a far away shore when you re poor it s easy to bare with sunshine and soft summer air very soon i will take any troubled chance that i can though i dream like a child for my dreams i ll work like a man i ll work and reprieve for my to ticket to ride where the sun shines for me surviving any storms and be wild to be warm that s the way i must be i ll be leaving behind no regrets and hold my past and i ll go to the sea as i ll sail to freedom at last take me along a long way from here take me along to a far away shore when you re poor it s easy to bare with sunshine and soft summer air take me along a long way from here take me along to a far away shore when you are poor it s easy to bare with sunshine and soft summer ai

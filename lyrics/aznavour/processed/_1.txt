but fate deals out the hands we must take what its chosen when in an idle glance you appeared time was frozen no i could never forget i look upon your face i can t believe my eyes passing times often cruel it fades youth like a flower but you have never changed where the years but an hour no i could never forget never forget married me heavens no i m still single but happy to be free unattached and between you and me better that than ill matched though at times i feel lonely but enough about me let s drink to you and life how have you been all these years are you happy and well no i guess i could tell and your marriage it s ended do your parents regret that s not what they intended no i could never forget who could have ever known without a single word that we d come face to face there d not been any reason i thought all things must die as a time or a season no i could never forget i don t know what to say it s like some crazy dream the way the past returns all my memories unbroken yes i remember too every word that was spoken no i could never forget never forget youth a foolish age we thought love was our treasure but your father said no you would marry someone with position and name you d receive life s full measure and he said with a smile i m sure you understand so with love in our eyes we exchanged last goodbyes but your father was shrewd all my unanswered letters forced me soon to conclude things had worked for the better no i could never forget the hour is getting late this place is closing down come yes come i ll walk you home through the streets dark and empty like in our foolish days of kisses stolen nightly no i could never forget each season was for us a season for our love and we were not afraid as autumn turned to winter as long as there s youth it is springtime forever no no i could never forget never forget it s strange the warmth i feel in these moments together we ve recaptured the time in the midst of our youth when two hearts were in line and were light as a feather but we both know the truth we must live for today so i ll ask if i may if you d like me to stay if this time we can share what the past was concealing if you re lonely and care if you have the same feeling if you re remembering yet all the things i could never forge

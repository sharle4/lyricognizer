dance in the old fashioned way won t you stay in my arms just melt against my skin and let me feel your heart don t let the music win by dancing far apart come close where you belong let s hear our secret song dance in the old fashioned way won t you stay in my arms and we ll discover heights we never knew before if we just close our eyes and dance around the floor that gay old fashioned way that makes me love you more come closer forget about the others it s nice to be like this cheek to cheek in the old fashioned way hahaha it s funny but i have the feeling that we re dancing as our parents used to do well maybe they weren t wrong the world changes love stays dance in the old fashioned way won t you stay in my arms and we ll discover heights we never knew before if we just close our eyes and dance around the floor that gay old fashioned way that makes me love you more mmm
